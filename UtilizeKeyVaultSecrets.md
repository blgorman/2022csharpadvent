# Utilize KeyVault Secrets from C#

This blog post is created for the 2022 [C# Advent Calendar Christmas 2022 event](https://csadvent.christmas/).  I'd like to thank []() for the opportunity to contribute.

The focus of this post will be a demonstration on how to utilize C# to access Key Vault Secrets in your solutions.

If you want to work along, you'll need an Azure subscription.  The code for the final solution will be included in this repository.  Alternatively, creation of the code should be pretty trivial and you would likely be able to just create this as you read along.
